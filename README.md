The code runs using a preprocessed version of [Facebook's data center network](#https://research.facebook.com/blog/2017/01/data-sharing-on-traffic-pattern-inside-facebooks-datacenter-network/). We can make our input dataset available on demand.

# Setup

- The code assumes that the input data is ordered in folders of shape `../facebook_final/{cluster}_timesteps{timesteps}_offset{offset}_windowLength{windowLength}_{valueDescription}_top-{size}_{granularityText}/{str(time)}.csv`
- Each argument in bracket is explained in [this section](#dataset-parameters)
- run `python3 main.py` to run the code


##  Dataset parameters

In the first lines of `main.py` can be found different parameters to execute the code


```
clusters = ["clusterA", "clusterB", "clusterC"]
```
- Clusters to plot.
  - clusterA correspond to the Web servers
  - cluseerB to the MySQL servers.
  - clusterC to the Hadoop applications.
```
sizes = [10000]
```
- Number of the maximum number of senders/receivers


```
granularities = [("rack", "rack")]
```
- granularities is a list of all granularities to study. If you want to plot traffic from a to b, add to the granularities list the couple (a,b).
The avaiable granularities are rack or sever, leading to 4 possible granularities couple
```
# a configuration is a triplet (timesteps,offset,windowLength)
configurations = [(10, 2, 900), (30, 6, 300), (150, 30, 60)]
```
- Configuration of the traffic. Used to set different timesteps, offesets and widowLengths.


## Clustering parameters

```
readClusters = False
```

- Set to `True` to run the code with a clustering on a file. When this parameter is set to `False`, pcv will be used to output a clustering.


```
manyRanks = [0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]
```
- Threshold rank of the clustering algorithms

```
k = 7
```
- The k of the clustering algorithm for plotting
